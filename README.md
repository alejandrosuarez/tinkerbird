TinkerBird is a Chrome-native vector database designed for efficient storage and
retrieval of high-dimensional vectors (embeddings). Its query engine, written in
TypeScript, leverages HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexes for fast
vector retrieval. The storage layer utilizes IndexedDB, optionally enhanced by
an LRU cache for further optimization.

One significant challenge facing large language models (LLMs) is their tendency
to generate syntactically correct but factually inaccurate responses, a
phenomenon known as hallucination. To address this issue, vector databases play
a critical role by providing LLMs with access to relevant context to help it
structure it's response. This not only improves the accuracy of LLM responses
but also minimizes computational costs by preventing irrelevant information from
entering the context. Additionally, vector databases ensure that LLMs are
anchored to the required context.

TinkerBird disrupts traditional RAG workflows, which rely heavily on server-side
interactions. By co-locating data and embeddings, it eliminates the roundtrip
delay associated with server communication. With Tinkerbird, sensitive data
remains local, benefiting from benefits of vector search, without the associated
compliance and security risks.

TinkerBird uses IndexedDB as it's storage layer, which in turn builds upon Blobs
and LevelDB storage systems. TinkerBird by using Indexeddb, benefits from it's
adoption, stability and familiarity as native choice for offline first
workflows.

TinkerBird was brought to you by a team of highly caffeinated developers who
should probably be working on something more productive. But hey, here we are.
